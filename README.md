# Welcome to OtreraLabs

**We believe in software that adapts to humans, not the other way around.**

OtreraLabs is a specialized engineering collective. We are engineers who ship code. We operate as a high-density engineering team supported by a swarm of autonomous agents, allowing us to remain small, agile, and focused entirely on product excellence.
